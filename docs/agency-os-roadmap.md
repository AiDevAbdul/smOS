# smOS — Agency OS Roadmap & Gap-Check

_Living document. Last updated 2026-06-22. Direction chosen: **Full Agency OS** — smOS should run the whole agency, not just the marketing execution._

This is the master gap-check: what a complete 2026 agency-grade social platform includes, what smOS already has, and the prioritized path to "zero to hero." Grounded in a current-state code audit + competitive research across Sprout, Hootsuite, Later, Metricool, AgencyAnalytics, Brandwatch, GoHighLevel, Vendasta, HoneyBook, and the AI-native cohort.

## Where smOS stands

smOS is **not behind on sophistication — it's narrow on coverage.** It's a deep Meta performance-marketing engine that already does what most "competitors" can't (real paid execution, not just deferring to Meta's native manager). 28/32 skills are fully built; 2 are stubs (`/pre-audit` Python-only, `/creative-agent`). It is **Meta-only** and has **no commercial back-office** — which is exactly the chosen build direction.

### Where smOS already beats the market
- **Real paid execution** — campaign/adset/ad creation, automated optimizer rules, CAPI setup, attribution, audience mapping. The SMM category is overwhelmingly organic-first; few do this.
- **L2 agentic architecture, default-PAUSED + hard guardrails** — the 2026 best-practice design; Meta's own Ads CLI (Apr 2026) mirrors it.
- **Decision logging with reasoning** (`optimizer_log`) — agent observability incumbents are racing to add.
- **Fail-closed AI-content disclosure** — ahead of Meta's Mar 2026 policy.
- **Phase 0 zero-start** — brand identity build + account/web bootstrap with 3 fail-closed human gates. Rare end-to-end.

## Direction: Full Agency OS

The chosen north star is for smOS to run the **whole agency** — acquisition → contracting → execution → reporting → billing — not just marketing execution. That makes **Domain 9 (Agency Operations)** the near-term priority, layered on top of the existing execution engine.

### The commercial back-office to build
A new **Agency Ops layer** (sibling to the marketing skills), reusing existing infra (Supabase persistence, render_pdf HTML+PDF, the guard/approval pattern, per-client profiles):

1. **Client CRM / pipeline** — `clients` table already exists; extend to a lead→prospect→client pipeline with status, contacts, retainer terms. Feeds `/pre-audit` (acquisition) on the front and reporting on the back.
2. **Proposals (`/proposal`)** — AI-generated pitch deck from `/pre-audit` findings + a service/pricing catalog → HTML+PDF (reuse render_pdf). HoneyBook-style; biggest acquisition lever.
3. **Contracts + e-sign (`/contract`)** — generate scope/retainer agreement from the accepted proposal; integrate an e-sign provider (DocuSign/Dropbox Sign API).
4. **Billing / invoicing (`/billing`)** — recurring retainer invoices + ad-spend pass-through; Stripe API. Pairs with the CRM retainer terms.
5. **Client portal upgrade** — turn `/portal` from a read-only report page into a real white-label client portal: live dashboards, **no-login approval** of content/strategy, invoice view, asset downloads.
6. **Internal ops** — time tracking + capacity planning (the two near-universal market gaps) so the agency can see margin per client.

### Cheap, high-differentiation moats to fold in alongside
- **Expose smOS as an action-capable MCP server** — you're already an agent over the APIs; few competitors have this.
- **AI brand/compliance approval guardrails** — nobody in the market has it; the guard chokepoint is already the architecture.
- **GEO / AI-visibility audit** in `/pre-audit` — does the prospect appear in ChatGPT/Gemini/Perplexity answers? A fresh acquisition hook.

## Phased roadmap

**Phase 5 — Agency Ops foundation (chosen priority)**
1. CRM/pipeline schema + skill (extend `clients`)
2. `/proposal` (AI deck from `/pre-audit` → HTML+PDF)
3. Finish `/pre-audit` Node wrapper (currently Python-only) — it's the front of the funnel the CRM/proposal depend on
4. `/contract` + e-sign integration
5. `/billing` (Stripe) — retainers + ad-spend pass-through
6. `/portal` upgrade → real white-label client portal (no-login approvals)

**Phase 6 — Connectors & moats (parallel, low effort)**
- GA4 + Slack/Teams connectors (Slack alongside Discord)
- Expose smOS as an MCP server
- AI brand/compliance approval guard
- GEO/AI-visibility audit in `/pre-audit`

**Phase 7 — Multi-platform (when breadth is needed)**
- Publish-once abstraction (base post + per-platform overrides + adapters; partial-failure first-class)
- Threads first (reuses Meta infra; ads = a placement flag in `/launch`)
- Then TikTok (organic+paid; plan the publishing-app audit), then Google Ads (MCC + dev token)

**Phase 8 — Organic depth & new domains (optional)**
- Visual calendar UI, per-client trained voice, AI inbox replies + auto-moderation, multimodal listening
- Influencer/UGC domain (discovery → rights → payments → attribution)

## Multi-platform feasibility (reference for Phase 7)
| Channel | Add priority | Organic API | Paid API | Main gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Threads | 1st (cheapest) | publish + replies + insights | placement in Meta Marketing API | standard app review |
| TikTok | 2nd (demand) | publish + analytics; **no comment/DM API** | full Marketing API | publish-app audit (else SELF_ONLY) |
| Google Ads | 3rd (paid duopoly) | n/a | Search/PMax/Display/YouTube | MCC + dev token (backlogged 2026) |
| LinkedIn | B2B books | pages + comments + analytics; **no DMs** | full ads API | brutal partner approval |
| WhatsApp | conversational/non-US | template + session msgs | n/a | template approval + per-msg pricing |
| Pinterest | relevant verticals | pins + analytics | full + CAPI | Trial→Standard sandbox gate |
| X | situational | metered pay-per-use + 2M read cap | **ads API free** | cost modeling |

_Realistically end-to-end automatable: Meta, Threads, Google Ads, Pinterest, Snapchat/Reddit Ads, GBP. Gated/metered: TikTok, X, WhatsApp, YouTube. Not automatable: LinkedIn DMs, organic Snapchat, TikTok comments/DMs, YouTube Community posts._
